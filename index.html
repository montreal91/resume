                    Writing this program I was aiming two major goals.
                    First, to write my very first game. 
                    Second, to learn <em>Panda3D</em> at some basic level.
                    Game came out very simple but very entertaining to play.
                    Also, it was my first program I've paid close attention to readability of my code.<br>

                    <strong>Complex Tennis</strong><br>
                    I am a huge tennis fan so once I've decided to simulate the 
                    game at some basic level using random.
                    At that moment I was studying Java, so first implementation was made with this language.
                    But long after that I've wrote Python implementation and now Python version is far more advanced
                    than Java version. Mostly because it has relatively rich GUI and uses PySide for that purpose.

                    This 6 programs I've wrote during my course on computer graphics and
                    it was first touch with OpenGL and some main concepts.
                    To write this program I've used OpenGL and freeglut to create windows.
